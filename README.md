# Welcome to my new Data structure and algorithm project Created in React.
# 🚀 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive **React application** that visualizes popular pathfinding algorithms step by step.  
Built with **Create React App**, deployed on **Vercel**.  

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 **Algorithms Supported**  
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm (weighted, shortest path)  
  - A* Search (weighted, heuristic-based)  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS, unweighted, shortest path)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS, unweighted, exploratory)  

- 🖥 **Dynamic UI**
  - Algorithm selector with descriptions  
  - Speed control for visualization  
  - Toggle walls & weights  
  - Random maze generator  

- 🎨 **Visualization**
  - Step-by-step animation of visited nodes  
  - Highlighted shortest path  
  - Smooth transitions and interactive grid  

- 📚 **Sidebar Info Panel**
  - Shows how each algorithm works  
  - Best use cases explained in simple terms

## 🔧 Getting Started

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pathfinding-visualizer
npm install
```

Run the app locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

To deploy:
```bash
npm run build
```
Then push your code to GitHub and import the repo into [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
